# GithubActivityLedDashboard
An LED dashboard to show your Github commit activity. I made this as a physical reminder to work on my coding projects. Seeing my (lack of) activity on my github is a great motivational tool.  
The dashboard shows 2 weeks worth of Github activity using LEDs to indicate activity. 

## Hardware
An ESP32 is used to get the github activity information from a ThinkSpeak API. It also controls the LEDs for the dashboard.
WS2811 LED strips are used for indicating github activity.
